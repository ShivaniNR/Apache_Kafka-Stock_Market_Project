# Stock Market Kafka Real Time Data Engineering Project

## Introduction

This project is a part of an end-to-end data engineering pipeline focused on real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka. It is inspired by this [GitHub](https://github.com/darshilparmar/stock-market-kafka-data-engineering-project) project and aims to provide hands-on experience with Kafka’s data streaming capabilities.

The primary goal is to understand Apache Kafka’s workflow and its role in real-time data processing, rather than performing in-depth data analysis.

The project follows this flow:

1. **Kafka Producer**: Sends stock market data to a Kafka topic.
2. **Kafka Consumer**: Reads the data from the topic and stores it in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Technology Used

- Programming Language - Python
- Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2
- Apache Kafka
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)

## Dataset Used

Stocks related dataset is used. The dataset is not analysed as the project is focused on understanding Apache Kafka and in operation side of Data Engineering.

Here is the dataset used in the video - https://github.com/darshilparmar/stock-market-kafka-data-engineering-project/blob/main/indexProcessed.csv
